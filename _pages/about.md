Hello and thank you for visiting my website. I'm very excited to share my research and teaching experience with you. I am an applied statistician and lecturer whose research focuses on educational equity and student success. My research passion lies at the intersection of Applied Statistics, Psychometrics, and Education and is focused on issues of education inequality that exist in higher education, and the use of computer adaptive testing for high-stake assessments. My primary research interest focuses on the development and interpretation of multidimensional nonlinear latent variable modeling and their applications to Psychometric models. My secondary research interest focuses on the refinement and development of statistical models used to perform nonlinear multidimensional clustering in education data and how those clusters can be used in Item Response Theory models.

I am currently pursuing my PhD in Measurement & Statistics at University of Washington with Dr. Chun Wang as my advisor. You can learn more about our lab [here](https://sites.uw.edu/pmetrics/)

Previously, I earned my Master of Science in Applied Statistics from California State University, Long Beach in 2020 where my research focused on educational equity and graduation rates for first-time freshman. My Master's thesis is titled: "A Multivariate Statistical Analysis of Major Change Patterns and Significant Factors That Influence Graduation Rates: A Case Study at California State University, Long Beach". The goal of my research was to determine if students who changed majors graduated at a statistically significantly different rate then students who did not change majors. My secondary goal was to determine what significant factors influenced time to graduation and if a classification algorithm can be developed to predict and classify a studentâ€™s time to graduation. I developed a Multinomial Logistic model which was used to identify and describe relationships between predictor variables and a multi-level dependent variable, I also implemented Fisher's Multipopulation Linear Discriminant Analysis to classify new observations and performed extensive research on clustering algorithms that can be used with both categorical and continuous data.
