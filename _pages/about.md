Hello and thank you for visiting my website. I'm very excited to share my research and teaching experience with you. I am an applied statistician and lecturer whose research focuses on educational equity and student success. My statistics research focuses on latent variable modeling, especially Psychometric models such as Item Response Theory and Factor Analysis, and the application of Bayesian parameter estimation. My educational research focuses on the application of these models to secondary and post-secondary student data. I am especially interested in the applications of Item Response Theory and other Psychometric models to study testing and education equity along with using latent variable models to identify demographic and academic barriers that historically disadvantaged students face. We as educators have a duty to support all students, and I believe that by studying student data we can identify meaningful information and help make our education system more equitable.

I earned my Master of Science in Applied Statistics from California State University, Long Beach in 2020 where my research focused on educational equity and graduation rates for first-time freshman. My Master's thesis is titled: "A Multivariate Statistical Analysis of Major Change Patterns and Significant Factors That Influence Graduation Rates: A Case Study at California State University, Long Beach". The goal of my research was to determine if students who changed majors graduated at a statistically significantly different rate then students who did not change majors. My secondary goal was to determine what significant factors influenced time to graduation and if a classification algorithm can be developed to predict and classify a studentâ€™s time to graduation. I developed a Multinomial Logistic model which was used to identify and describe relationships between predictor variables and a multi-level dependent variable, I also implemented Fisher's Multipopulation Linear Discriminant Analysis to classify new observations and performed extensive research on clustering algorithms that can be used with both categorical and continuous data.

I am currently working on my PhD in Measurement & Statistics at University of Washington with Dr. Chun Wang as my advisor.
