This paper looks for a connection between television advertisements and support for the 2018 Washington State ballot initiative I-1631 that, if passed, would have made Washington the first state in the US to adopt a carbon tax policy. We find no evidence of a suppressive effect from the television ads. In fact, we find ads were likely placed in areas where (1) support for the carbon tax was likely high and (2) the ads would be seen by the most viewers.
