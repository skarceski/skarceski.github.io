My goal as a teacher is to help students learn how to think critically and sociologically about the world around them, to engage in debate with others, and to clearly communicate ideas through writing and speaking. Through graduate school I have gained a significant amount of teaching experience. I've taught substantive area courses, sociological theory, a civic engagement practicum, an undergraduate research practicum, and the undergraduate honors course. Each has required different teaching skills and prepared me to teach students not only how to understand research and social theory, but also to conduct their own research and effectively communicate the importance of their work.   

I've taught courses in political sociology, sociological theory, undergraduate honors sociology, sociology of work and occupations, undergraduate, law and society, and the introductory survey into sociology. I've been a TA for social statistics, sociological theory, and intro to sociology. I've also supervised a number of independent studies, an interdisciplinary honors thesis, and a sociology undergraduate honors thesis. My research experience has given me the knowledge to teach courses in environmental sociology/politics, comparative politics, fiscal sociology, and economic sociology.

I also teach workshops and tutorials in quantitative methods and statistical programming, both at the novice and advanced levels. In the research practicum and honors courses, I teach undergraduate students how to clean and manipulate data, fit statistical model (linear, logistic, multilevel and panel), and visualize inferential and descriptive statistics (ggplot2). I have research experience with various R packages used for data manipulation, visualization, counterfactual estimations, table creation (including model output), spatial data (dealing with maps, shapefiles, and areal weighted interpolation), statistical modelling (OLS, GLM, multilevel, Bayesian), survey data, and text analysis (structural topic models). While most of my experience is in R, I also have experience with teaching undergraduate students SPSS, Stata, and SQL.
