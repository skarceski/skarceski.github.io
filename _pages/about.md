I am a doctoral candidate in the Department of Sociology at the University of Washington in Seattle. My research falls into the areas of political sociology, fiscal sociology, and political economy, with substantive focuses on the political discourse and social science around political centrism and moderation, the political and institutional determinants of carbon taxation, and the political economy of taxation. I have extensive teaching and mentoring experience in the areas of political sociology, sociological theory, and undergraduate research, and technical skills in quantitative methods, data manipulation, data visualization, and statistical programming, primarily using R.
