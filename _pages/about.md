I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in Public Policy in the Department of Sociology at Colby College and a research affiliate with the [Institute for Futures Studies](https://www.iffs.se/en/) in Stockholm, Sweden. My research falls into the areas of environmental politics, political and fiscal sociology, and public opinion. I am a multi-method social science researcher with experience using a wide range of quantitative and qualitative methods. My work has been published in climate, public health, political science, and economics journals, on topics such as the connections between air pollution and mental health, tax systems and good governance, economic growth and the size of the state, and political ads and electoral outcomes, and tax structure and support for carbon taxes. Currently I'm working on several projects, studies of national-level carbon tax adoptions, public opinion on climate policy, perceptions of corruption in the United States, and attitudes toward tax and spending policies.
