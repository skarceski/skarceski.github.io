## bekah -  introductory paragraph/statement (thesis-style) -- pragmatic

My research is driven by a motivation to understand policy change in the areas taxation, the environment and climate, and social welfare. My research career began with studies of the determinants of tax structure and tax revenues, and carbon pricing policies. In the case of carbon taxation, I came to realize that the lack of adequate mitigation efforts was not due to a lack of proposed solutions. Nor was it due to a lack of public support. In fact, polling suggests large majorities of Americans support climate pricing policies (like a carbon tax) and other environmental protections. Given this, it appears the failure to enact more substantial climate mitigation policies, at least in the United States is, in part, a failure of democratic responsiveness. The people are not getting what they want.


This conclusion led me to the American political discourse. In particular, I found confusing, contradictory statements about the "political center" and the "moderate" middle of politics. For example, we are told the "centrist" Democratic politicians are those ones opposing things like progressive taxation (and other forms of redistribution and decommodification). In this case, the political center refers to the center of the political actor space -- the center of the space occupied by members of the two dominant political parties. At the same time, we are told centrist candidates hold the power to appeal to Americans who identify with both parties as well as the Independents. These arguments relate to the logic of the Downsian median voter model, where the actors (political parties) that move to the "center" of public preferences will gain the most electoral support. This is also how public opinion scholars often define the "center" -- according to the "center" of public opinion.

Clearly the center of public opinion is not the same as the center of the political actor space. Yet when pundits, centrist proponents, and even political scientists (see Hall's *Who Wants to Run?*), suggest more "centrist" or "moderate" politicians are the solution to our dysfunctional political system, it presents a contradiction. In effect, what is referred to as the center is often starkly at odds with what the public wants. I am currently investigating the discourse around political centrism, how it gives the impression that popular policies are unpopular, infeasible, irrational, or irresponsible (policies like government-run health care, progressive taxation, jobs guarantees, and protecting Social Security and Medicare). "Centrism" most often takes the form of *opposing* any form of progressive change.

The description above, I hope, gives justification for why I study what I study. Currently, my projects include (1) an investigation into the meaning of centrism (and moderation) in American politics; (2) an analysis of public opinion on progressive taxation; (3) a comparative study of the institutional determinants of carbon taxation, and (4) various projects related to the political economy of taxation.

[^1]: An important exception is case of the estate tax. Scholars have been puzzled by majority opposition to the estate tax, even by many citizens who will never be affected by it. Larry Bartels ([*Unequal Democracy*](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691172842/unequal-democracy)) shows that even well-informed respondents (defined according to repsonses about their representatives) don't hold systemtaically different positions on the estate tax. However, the work of Spencer Piston ([*Class Attitudes in America*](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/class-attitudes-in-america/F703C74A82650B54F18353E71EECB55A)) demonstrates the conclusion that Americans oppose the estate tax is largely shaped by the fact that Americans significantly overestimate the percentage of families that pay into it. When they are provided accurate information -- that it affects fewer than 1% of households -- support falls off dramatically.
