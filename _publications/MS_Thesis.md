excerpt: 'In 2015 the California State University system launched Graduation Initiative 2025 which aims to eliminate the equity gaps in degree completion and increase the average four-year graduation rate from 19% to 40% and the average six-year graduation rate from 57% to 70%. To support CSULB in meeting these goals, this study focuses on performing a multivariate statistical analysis to determine the effects of major change and various demographic and academic factors on timely graduation.'
