I am a doctoral candidate in the Department of Sociology at the University of Washington in Seattle. My research falls into the areas of political sociology, fiscal sociology, and political economy, with substantive focuses on the political discourse and social science around political centrism and moderation, the political and institutional determinants of carbon taxation, and the political economy of taxation. I have extensive teaching and mentoring experience in the areas of political sociology, sociological theory, and undergraduate research, and technical skills in quantitative methods, data manipulation, data visualization, and statistical programming. 

I also currently work as a consultant at the [Center for Social Science and Computational Research](https://depts.washington.edu/csscr/) (CSSCR) at the University of Washington and serve as a virtual mentor to fellows affiliated with [CAMI Health](https://cami-health.org/) and the [Public Health Institute](https://www.phi.org/) (PHI). At CSSCR, I assist undergraduate and graduate students (ocassionally faculty) implement and troubleshoot statistical analysis, data management, and data visualizations in various software programs (Stata, R, SPSS, Excel). For CAMI and PHI, I work with a group of public health scholars from various institutions in Sub-Saharan Africa, helping them build skills in data management, data visualization, and statistical anaylses in R.
