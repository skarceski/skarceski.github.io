# An Item Response Theory Analysis of Biology Freshman Survey

A psychometric analysis of a survey administered to incoming freshman at California State University, Long Beach who were admitted into the Biological Sciences major. The goal of the analysis was to determine if there is any significant difference between the latent trait estimates of students who were admitted as Biological Sciences Majors to CSULB in 2020 as compared to students admitted in 2021, determine if there is a significant difference in latent trait estimates between male and female students, and determine if there are any significant correlations between latent trait estimates.
