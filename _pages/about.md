I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Sociology at the University of Washington (UW). My research falls into the areas of political sociology, fiscal sociology, and political economy, with substantive focuses on the political discourse and social science around political centrism (and moderation), the political and institutional determinants of carbon taxation, and the political economy of tax systems. I have extensive teaching experience in the areas of political sociology, sociological theory, and undergraduate research, and technical skills in quantitative methods, data visualization, and statistical programming (primarily with R).
