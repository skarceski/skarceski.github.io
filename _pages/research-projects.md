### Centrism and moderation in American politics

*In progress* My dissertation represents the first comprehensive, critical investigation of centrism and moderation  in contemporary American politics (I find they are used interchangeably and treat them as such). Other scholars have studied centrism in the context of electoral outcomes, political polarization, the campaign process, or focused on the rhetoric of politicians labeled "cenrist." My research demonstrates the absence of an agreed-upon definition of centrism, an observation I find true among journalists, politicians, and social scientists. The lack of a shared definition largely goes unnoticed, or at least unmentioned. 

Centrism holds a variety of meanings. It can refer to a median voter (or citizen preference) center, a middle-ground ideological position (or set of positions), or the space in the middle of political actor preferences/behavior (primarily between two parties). It can be determined through the aggregation of preferences (where diversity represents centrism), it can refer to a statistic in a distribution (median or mean), or simply a midpoint in an abstract space (like ideology). In other cases, centrism is an ambiguous call to transcend political divisions, a call for "smart" or common sense policies, or a form of expert-led technocratic decision making. While centrism can mean so many different things, it certainly cannot be assumed to mean all of these at the same time, and this is one of the issues I focus on.  

Journalists, social scientists, public intellectuals, think tanks, and politicians seem to employ centrism in a way that, the supply of centrism (politicians, policies, or positions identified as centrist) does not match the demand (the "centrist" public opinion, or median preference). In fact, my analysis of newspaper articles shows the policies most often identified with centrism represent a set of policies preferred by economic elites – lower taxes, lower spending, privatizing entitlements, reducing the debt, and general support for free markets. The policies most often identified as not centrist tend to be policies supported by majorities, often durable majorities, of American citizens – like a higher minimum wage, government-run health care, strengthening Social Security, and higher taxes on corporations and high incomes. I find this represents efforts to define the contested space of the political center. 

My future work will further explore these ideas. In particular, the empirical use of centrism in American political discourse is ripe for the application of content analysis and natural language processing. Further, there is a need to (1) highlight what I believe are serious flaws in the ways centrism is operationalized and measured in political science, (2) explore the historical origins of the contemporary brand of centrism in the United States, and (3) consider how the case of centrism compares to historical examples of ideological hegemony, the abuse of knowledge-based authority, and elite influence over political discourse.
